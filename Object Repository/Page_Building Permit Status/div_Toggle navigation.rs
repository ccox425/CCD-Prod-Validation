                    Check the status of my building permit application
                    
                        There are two methods to check the status of your plan review: (1) using the robust e-permits system or (2) using the log number search function on this page. E-permits is the public-facing window into Denver’s development permit records. With it, you can view all permits associated with an address, see review status, download the final approved plans (if plans were submitted electronically), pay permit fees, schedule inspections, check inspection results, and more. 
                        Both methods will display a list of all reviewing disciplines, which may be more reviews that what your project requires. Your specific building permit is ready when each discipline involved in the review of your plans has been marked “approved.” Please note if a review is marked “separate submittal required,” this must be submitted and approved before the building permit can be issued.

                        (1) Enter the e-permits system and then select the Development Svcs tab. You do not need to set up an account to check the status of permits or inspections.
                                        
                    
                        (2) Search using a record number or an address.
                                        
                    
                        (3) Under record info on the permit detail page, you’ll find plan review details under processing status, inspection results under inspections, and approved plans under attachments.
